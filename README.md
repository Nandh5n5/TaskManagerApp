# TaskManagerApp
users will see a clean and intuitive user interface.
The main screen displays a list of tasks in a RecyclerView. Each task shows its title, description, due date, priority, category, and status. Users can add a new task by clicking on a button or using a floating action button. This action will open a new screen/dialog where they can enter task details, such as title, description, due date, priority, category, etc.Users can tap on a specific task to view its details or make edits. This action will lead to another screen where they can modify the task details.Setting Due Dates and Priority:Each task includes a due date and priority level (low, medium, high), allowing users to organize and prioritize their tasks.Users can assign a category to each task (e.g., work, personal, shopping) to further organize their to-do list.
Tasks can be marked as "New," "In Progress," or "Completed." Users can update the status of a task based on their progress.The app uses local storage (SQLite database in this case) to persistently store the tasks, ensuring that users can access their to-do list even after closing the app.Users can delete a task if it's no longer relevant or completed.
The app features a clean and responsive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with their to-do list.
